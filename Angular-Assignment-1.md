First of all, thank you for showing interest to become a part of Tekdi. We wish you best of luck for the test. Please read the entire document carefully before you start writing code.

# Background
The most common use of Angular Frontends is using CRUD APIs to save and view data. We want you to create a Angular application to view a list of records, add records and edit records.

# Assignment
We want you to create a Angular application that has the following areas. You may use any CSS like bootstrap to make the pages look nice.

### Form to create a new Person
- The form should have fields for `name`, `email`, `dob`, `avatar` and `country`

### List of Persons
- On this page show the Name, Email, Avatar and Age (not date of birth) of the person. To show the age, you should create a pipe.
- Clicking on the name of any person should open the form to edit the details
- Show the list in a "card" format rather than a simple list. (CardView should be a custom component with input parameters).

Note : You DO NOT need to create any API. The API is already created. The details are available here - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3129705/RWTpsGbZ


# Assessment Criteria
- Code quality of the Angular Code.
- Code quality of the HTML and CSS if any.
- Look and feel of the form and list pages.

# Deliverable
Create a repository in your github account and commit the code into that repository. Send us the link to the repository.
